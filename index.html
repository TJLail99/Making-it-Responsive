	</h2>
	
	<p class="text">

		I have some experience with Web Development from the various courses I have taken. 
		Some of these courses were in highschool, but most of them were at College.
		Web Design has always been something I've been interested in.

	</p>
		
	<h2>

		What I hope to learn from this course:

		

	</h2>
	
	<p class="text">
		I would like to learn how to do in depth Web Development. Every class I've taken has only gone over basics over and over again.
		I believe that if I actually learn how to do it, I will enjoy it.
	</p>

	<h2>
		What I would like to do with this new knowledge:
	</h2>

	<p class="text">
		With this new knowledge of Web Design, I hope to use it further in life whether it be for college or work.
		I know a few people who do this as a job, and have considered asking them how I would get started on that.
